            <p className="Abiola_About_Paragraph"> Hello my name is Mathew O Abiola born and raised in Nigeria, I am currently studying computer science
                at SFSU; finishing this fall. I am a tall smiley chocolate guy, I laugh a lot but very quiet at the same time due to the nature of my shyness;
                I am interested into stuff that amaze me but ultimately techy and crypto and new world innovation in both web2 and web3.
            </p>
            <p className="Abiola_About_Paragraph">What has sparked my initial interest in CS is my hunger for techy stuff since a very young
                I was into lots of hardware plays since the age of 8;
                I never knew anything about coding or developing till the age of 18 after I came to America;
                then I knew I had a lot to learn and by doing that I have to study computer science in real theory and quantitative reasoning.
            </p>
            <p className="Abiola_About_Paragraph">I am "Github Master" for this prject due to low knowledge on the front end and back end aspect but
                I am learning as we build something from scratch.
